Hello! Welcome to this <strong>bank_account</strong> project for <strong>ACS 1111</strong>!
<br>
<br>
The goal is to incorporate Python and Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in order to successfully create a bank account that has different attributes.
<br>
<br>
Those attributes should hopefully include a full name of the bank account owner, the account number associated with that name, and a balance amount. 
<br>
<br>
This is my first python and OOP project that I had to create without a tutorial, so please bare with me, and hopefully it turns out well!
